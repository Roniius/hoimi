 ostcasa.1.t:0 "Heart of The Workers"
 ostcasa.1.d:0 "1757, Castilian explorer Juan José Pérez Hernández landed on too new shores, him and the crews of his fleet set up a camp on the newly discovered land. Hernández named the new land Casaeste or Casa Este meaning East House, and had traveled back to Castile to convince the King to fund a new colony there lead by himself, the King agreed. Within ten years the colony had developed into the size of a small country and the camp into a large city, however the colony became popular and many countries attempted to establish their own colonies on the new land however most failed except for Sweden. Sweden had established a colony within close proximity of the Casaeste and slowly over time the two countries split the entire Island, fighting natives and at times each other. Islands surrounding the island were mainly taken by the Swedish and integrated into the Swedish colony.\n\nBy 1800 the two colonies were very intwined culturally, Castilian and swedish people had been mating for almost two decades and formed a new sub culture at the time called East Swedish however in 1801 a East Swedish man named Carlos Hedburg declared the Island as Ostcasa and East Swedish as Ostcasan, Ostcasa coming from the Swedish word for East Castilian word for house. Hedburg became a very famous politician in the colony that the colonial governments tried to put down but as he worked with natives he was able to hide out from them, Sweden and Spain both agreed to help eachother in hunting Hedburg down but to no avail he managed to stay in hiding until 1811 when him and many others rose up against the colonial governments. By 1820 Hedburg and Ostcasan revolutionaries took the Island and many surrounding Islands from the Swedish and Spanish and the nation prospoured for a little while..."

 ostcasa.2.t:0 "Heart of The Workers 2"
 ostcasa.2.d:0 "...In 1899 the military couped standing president, Frank Abesto and this angered much of the population, protests broke out. In reaction to the protests the military government took action to put it down and tried to establish concentration camps but failed horribly as people stormed public buildings and took over cities rapidly which allowed them access to the military bases located within them. It did not take long for revolutionaries to take over the nation in what was called The Second Ostcasan Revolution. Gorm Roldán, the revolutionary leader promised a democracy, equal rights and workers rights in the style of Ordaism however the democracy and equal rights did not go far.\n\nNow it is 1936 and Gorm Roldán still leads the nation as head of the Mannistes or Ordaist Party, the Party's committee is the main government body of Ostcasa and is divided into three main factions. The first faction is The Federalistoians who wish to decentralize the powers of the national government to the smaller state governments, the faction is lead by Isac Longo, a known bisexual man. Next is the Labouritian wing who wish to enact some of the promises from Gorm Roldán during the revolution, such as democracy and equal rights, their form of democracy would allow the election of the Ordaist Party National Committee, the committee members would then elect a representative from themselves to serve as President. The Labouritians are lead by Fiona Hedburg, descendant of Carlos Hedburg who lead Ostcasa to independence. The final faction within the party is the Centralistians who seek to put their leader Loke Cardenas into power, and establish a strong authoritarian regime to guide the nation into the future. The three factions are strongly opposed to each other and could be a threat to the nation, especially with Gorm Roldán getting older, the committee will have to elect a leader and hopefully the right leader is elected."

 ostcasa.3.t:0 "Filipeson Affair"
 ostcasa.3.d:0 "Almerique Filipeson, a member of the Ordaist Party National Committee was arrested today by Red Guard officers on the charges of collusion and conspiracy. Filipeson was the former President of Security of Ostcasa before being made President of Military Affairs in 1935 and was a close friend of General Secretary Gorm Roldán; however, after a five month long investigation by the Council of Security that was off the books. The investigation had shown that Filipeson had been feeding information to opposition groups both in and out of the country for large sums of money, had secret meetings with opposition leaders about organizing attacks and assassinations any many prominent politicans including the General Secretary himself. These traitorous actions should not be tolerated, trials are expected to begin and with the piles of evidence the Council of Security holds against him it is unlikely that he will be found innocent. Following the arrest, the investigation is being continued to see if any other government officials have assisted with this conspiracy and collusion."

 ostcasa.4.t:0 "Filipeson Trials"
 ostcasa.4.d:0 "Almerique Filipeson arrested for collusion and conspiracy has just gone through trial and has been found guilty, the trial lasted for over three months and is considered the most intense trial in the history of the country. The trial not only had Filipeson admit to guilt but also give away the names of five other Party National Committee members who have been arrested. In most cases, people like Filipeson would be hung for the acts he commited; however, since he gave names to Ostcasan People's Court they made a deal to have him serve one year in prison, followed by five years under house arrest as well as being banned from participating in government process. General Secretary Roldán while initially hesitant to accepting this deal eventually accepted due to the past he had with Filipeson, Roldán however has ordered the swift execution of the five people given away plus anyone else who is caught taking part in the collusion and conspiracy."

 ostcasa.5.t:0 "Roldán Falls Ill"
 ostcasa.5.d:0 "General Secretary Gorm Roldán was supposed to address the Party National Committee last week; however, he cancelled last minute for reasons his security did not release at the time. Now it has been almost a week without any public appearance of the General Secretary and people had grown worried until the President of The Party, Ivar Sandino announced that Roldán had grown ill with an unkown condition; however, has still been able to make decisions related to leading the country. President Sandino has said that he will do whatever it takes to make sure the government moves a long smoothly and he will take control of the government if the General Secretary needs it, this has worried some as rumours have begun to spread that President Sandino will attempt to push General Secretary Roldán out of the picture. For now all we can do is pray and hope that our General Secretary makes it through his sickness and that the President does not interfere."
 ostcasa.5.o1:0 "This Is Worrying"
 
 ostcasa.6.t:0 "Presidency Sidelined"
 ostcasa.6.d:0 "General Secretary Roldán has enacted reforms related to the presidency of the party, these reforms take all form of power away from the President and removes them from the order of succession. Roldán who had been growing sick had spoken with close advisors in fear that President Ivar Sandino was going to attempt to sideline the General Secretary; however, Roldán's personal secretary now speaking for him has stated that he will designate a successor in the coming weeks to continue bringing this nation into the future, securing it for the workers, peasants and farmers. \n\nIt was reported that President Sandino bolted out of the National Committee Hall upon hearing the news and party members such as Loke Cardenas and Isac Longo have spoken out against the sidelineing of the presidency as both were potential candidates for the posistion once Sandino's term was up at the end of the year. While this may be an authoritarian move on General Secretary Roldáns part, it may also be a needed move as to prevent a hostile and disgusting take over from other forces such as Sandino or in the future Longo or Cardenas."

 ostcasa.7.t:0 "A Heart Attack"
 ostcasa.7.d:0 "Earlier today when being visited by the new President of Military Affairs; William Larrouy, General Secretary Roldán suffered a heart attack. Roldán was rushed to the Gorm Roldán Hospital only five minutes from his home where Doctors operated for hours to keep him alive and while he made it out of the operating room, he is in a coma. With Roldán in a coma this leaves the Party National Committee in control of the nation for the time being, they will also be in charge of electing a new leader if Gorm Roldán does not make it through, since he has not named a successor. This is a sad day as our leader who lead us through the revolution and into victory slowly dies in a hospital while the Party National Committee rules in his place possibly ripping what he has built to shreds. May Roldán soon wake from his coma to take back his spot as leader of the nation, to keep it on the right path, the path of the workers, the path of the farmers, the path of the peasants, the path of Ordaism!"
 ostcasa.7.o1:0 "May He Heal Soon"
 
 ostcasa.8.t:0 "Roldán Passes On"
 ostcasa.8.d:0 "Our glorious General Secretary, our guide through revolution, our bringer of victory; Gorm Roldán has passed on in his sleep, three days ago he had suffered a heart attack from his undisclosed illness and complication after complication has lead to his death. He will be remembered as the father of The People's Republic of Ostcasa, our founder who we would not have gotten this far without. We still have a long way to go to achieve perfect Ordaism but in time we shall, we must trust whoever takes the mantle to continue us down the path of true Ordaism.\n\nFull power now resides in the Party National Committee, moves must be made fast to prevent dangerous things from happening;however, there are rumors going around that deals and alliances are being made and soon we may see the rise of a new General Secretary. Hopefully whomever is elected will be as glorious as Gorm Roldán and may Gorm Roldán rest in peace, as someone who has fought as strong as him deserves rest."
 ostcasa.8.o1:0 "Rest In Peace"
 
 ostcasa.9.t:0 "A Triumvirate Forms"
 ostcasa.9.d:0 "With the death of Gorm Roldán, the nation was left leaderless while the Ordaist Party National Committee controlled the government. The National Committee was expected to come together and vote on a new General Secretary; however, no major faction held enough seats to vote in favor of their leader, this lead to chaos in the National Committee for the past few days. However secretly behind closed doors; President of Military Affairs William Larrouy, President of Agriculture Kimberley Callalof, and leader of the Labouritian Faction Fiona Hedburg all agreed to march into the National Committee Hall and declare a Triumvirate. While most members of both major factions opposing the Labouritians cried out against it, many other people did not object too it as they were happy to see some form of end to the leaderless government even if only a temporary solution. Another factor that may have swayed people to not take action against the newly found Triumvirate was the charismatic and strong speech given by Kimberley Callalof as well as the Red Guard officers accompanying the trio. Hopefully they will be the solution needed for the perfect utopian Ostcasa, hopefully they will serve the country well."

 ostcasa.10.t:0 "8th OPNC Elections: Foreign Policy"
 ostcasa.10.d:0 "The election has now begun and it is time to determine what the make up of the 8th National Committee will look like; first up for discussion is foreign policy, all three major factions of the National Committee have separate views on foreign policy. First up is the Federalistoians, their foreign policy is a policy of staying peacefull with foreign nations while seeking alliances with friendly nations, specifically Ordaist leaning countries. Next is the Centralistians foreign policy, the Centralistian foreign policy holds the idea that the nation should be semi-aggressive when it comes for national interests as their leader, Loke Cardenas advocates for what he calls 'One State Ordaism' which believes that national interests should come first and Ordaism does not need to be spread globally; party members outside of the Centralistians have called this policy Nationalist and anti-worker. The finale is the Labouritians, the Labouritian foreign policy covers the idea of Global Revolution and that Ostcasa is responsible for spreading the revolution to workers world wide sometimes through aggression, sometimes through supporting Ordaist parties. How will the disccusion end?"

 ostcasa.11.t:0 "8th OPNC Elections: Native Policy"
 ostcasa.11.d:0 "Following the foreign policy discussion is the discussion on the rise of Native Liberation Movements across the nation, just like foreign policy each of the three main factions within the National Committee have their own policies on the topic. First up is Federalistoians, they hold the policy that it should be left up to each individual state on what to do with natives and their liberation movements; however, many members including their leader Isac Longo advocate for segregation. Next up is the Centralistians, the policy held by the Centralistians is a very xenophobic policy called 'Not Us' when Cardenas has spoken about this policy he has not given much detail on what he would do with the Natives and the liberation groups however many believe it would be very genocidal. The final policy up for discussion is that of the Labouritian faction, the Labouritians advocate for complete equality between the European Ostcasans and Native Ostcasans, stating that 'race does not determine if someone is a person or not and all people shall be treated the same'. How will this second disccusion end?"

 ostcasa.12.t:0 "8th OPNC Elections: Police Policy"
 ostcasa.12.d:0 "The next topic of disccusion for the election period is policy on the police in the nation, this stems from Gorm Roldáns large use of state police to strongman his actions and disccusion on how it will be used under new leadership. Like the previous two topics, each faction within the National Committee holds their own policies on the issue. First up is the Federalistoians, their policy on police is that the National Police force or Red Guard, be disbanded or decentralized in favour of local state based police forces. Next is the Centralistians, their policy is the closest to status quo with keeping the Red Guard; however, they wish to take it a step further and make them only follow the command of the General Secretary, it can only be assumed that the Centralistians want this so Loke Cardenas has his own secret police at his command if he were to be made General Secretary. The final policy is that of the Labouritians, their policy revolves around the idea of disbanding the Red Guard and not replacing it with any form of national police but instead enacting laws that allow for the people to form neighborhood watches and small militias that will prevent crime. How will the third discussion end?"

 ostcasa.13.t:0 "8th OPNC Elections: Democratic Policy"
 ostcasa.13.d:0 "The final topic of discussion for the electoral period is Democracy and the policies around it, currently there is not a large amount of democracy as people are currently allowed to vote however only for the Ostcasan Ordaist Party. Each of the three main factions within the National Committee hold their own separate ideas on this matter just like the last three topics. The first is the Federalistoians, they believe that democracy should be slightly limited at the national level while state governments should all be elected by the people, currently state Presidents are appointed by the General Secretary. Next up is the Centralistians, who unsurprisingly believe that all democracy should be abolished outside of the National Committee in which new members should be appointed by the General Secretary and approved by the current National Committee members, Loke Cardenas names the parties policy on the subject 'Centralized Democracy'. Finally the Labouritian policy supports free elections within the country, however with establishing protections within the constitution for Ordaism so that a future government would have a very hard time getting rid of Ordaism as they also advocate for the new constitution to make it so revisions of the constitution can not be done without 85% approval from the governing body. How will the fourth and final discussion end?"

 ostcasa.14.t:0 "Federalistoian Victory"
 ostcasa.14.d:0 "The Federalistoian faction of the Ordaist Party National Committee has emerged victorious in the 8th National Committee election, this now gives them major sway in the nation over policies; however, not as much as if they held the posistion of General Secretary but it is only so long until they could also hold that. The Federalistoians hold various policies from decentralizing the national government, to segregation between White European Ostcasans and Native Ostcasans, to religious liberalization; these policies face criticism from both the Centralistians and Labouritians but with those factions losing more influence it is possible that those criticisms will be silenced."

The Centralistian hold various policies from further centralizing of power around the general secretary, unspeakable things in regards to minorities, and totalitarianism; these policies face criticism from both the Labouritians and Federalistoians but with those factions losing influence it is really only a matter of time before those criticisms are silenced."

The Labouritian Faction holds various policies which include further liberalization of the government, integration of minorities, and global revolutionary ideas; these policies face criticism from both the Federalistoians and Centralistians but with those factions losing influence within the National Committee it is possible that those criticisms will die out."

 ostcasa.17.t:0 "National Committee Deadlock"
 ostcasa.17.d:0 "The election for the 8th Ordaist Party National Committee has seen the same poor results as the elections for the 7th, a deadlock with no faction gaining a majority. This leaves no faction with enough influence in the National Committee to get their policies through, in the event of there being no General Secretary it is unlikely the National Committee will be able to come together to vote on and elect a new one. This could be very worrying as groups of people may attempt to sieze power through unfair means, rumours are that there are already private discussions for deals and alliances to be made between party members. All we can do is hope the nation countinues down the right path."

 ostcasa_pop.1.d:0 "In late 1935 Ostcasan General Secretary Gorm Roldán created the Ostcasan Board of Comics after some comics from foreign nations made its way to the youth. Now the OBC has released their first comic, this comic is about a man with super strength and the ability to fly and he is named worker man, it has immedietly gained popularity among the youth. Worker Man, also known to people who know him as Carlos Sköld is a worker in a Pre-Revolutionary Ostcasa where he fights criminals such as bosses and landlords, Worker Man wears red coloured military clothing and a yellow mask to cover his face. While many were expecting comics about detectives and monsters like the foreign comics, the Worker Man hero was a nice surprise that has become popular fast with many people recieveing the comic free with the newspaper for their children to read.\n\n The Ostcasan government attempted to reach out to foreign nations to allow for the comic to be given out however most nations even fellow Ordaist nations have turned it down. However this does not mean the government will not try in the future, and many children are excited for the next issue of the Worker Man story."
