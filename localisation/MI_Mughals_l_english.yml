 ### Ideas ###

 MGH_Mughal_Decline:0 "Mughal Decline"
 MGH_Mughal_Decline_desc:0 "For the past few centuries, the Mughal Empire has been in decline. The Emperor has started losing his authority, and men below him plot to overthrow him. The attempted reforms have only saved the Empire for now. There is much to be done if the Mughal Empire is to be saved from its inevitable collapse and to reverse the decline."
 MGH_Unhappy_Subjects:0 "Unhappy Subjects"
 MGH_Unhappy_Subjects_desc:0 "The Mughal Empire is diverse, with many ethnicities and social groups inhabiting the small tracts of land it has. The people have lost faith in the Empire, and our finances plummet from our bankers leaving. Prices are high and wages are low, and many influential men and officers now work autonomously without the Emperor's interference."
