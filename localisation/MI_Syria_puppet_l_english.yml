 syria_puppet.1.t:0 "Establishing Leadership In Sicily"
 syria_puppet.1.d:0 "Now that we have established the Sicily Colony, we must chose leadership for the colony, currently we have a council overseeing things in Sicily, which we can chose to keep in power or we can chose to put one of two people in power. First we have Usama Al Shami, an important business man in the Islamic Republic, who was part of his fathers administration from 1923-1928. Our second option, seen most fit is Jamil al-Ulshi, former Vice President of Damascus, certainly having more political experience than Al Shami, he was caught up in his own scandal in 1932 after he was caught having an affair with his secretary. In the future things may come up and we may need to pick new leadership however for now, we should stick with these two men or leave power to the council."
