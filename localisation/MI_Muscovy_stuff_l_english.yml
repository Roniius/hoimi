During the years following the end of Mongol control, Muscovy was in a state of reconstruction and for a while it was weak, almost completely up for grabs to all outsiders but no one took the chance. After some time, Muscovy pulled itself up and began pushing back the old hordes of the former Mongol Empire.

 muscovy.1.d:0 "Muscovy stands as it has for centuries, a symbol of Eastern European independence. During the years following the end of Mongol control, Muscovy was in a state of reconstruction and for a while it was weak, almost completely up for grabs to all outsiders but no one took the chance. After some time, Muscovy pulled itself up and began pushing back the old hordes of the former Mongol Empire. Muscovy had become one of the largest nations in Europe, nearly unstoppable in it's might.\n\nTimes have changed since those days: The Grand Prince seems persistent on fruitless purges: The people fear he is mad. With Novgorod to the North and Lithuania to the west, the weakened nation may find itself in a more vulnerable position then ever. However that is only foreign problems, to say that Muscovy is clear of domestic problems would be a complete lie, in fact, Muscovy is sprawling with different factions, from the Marxist Party of Muscovy, known mostly as The Bolsheviks to the Russian Unionist Party. While most factions remain fairly peaceful, if the Grand Prince was to target them who knows what they may do?"

 muscovy.2.t:0 "A New Purge"
 muscovy.2.d:0 "It was a normal day, Moscow had people in the streets walking back and forth between their jobs and their homes, to the market place, the church or the many other places in the daily lives of a Muscovite. However it all took a sharp turn when a military barrack was stormed and personal including General Taras Maslov were dragged into a military truck and were driven off. The people of course knew what this was, it was another purge by the Grand Prince, as he consolidates his power very few generals remain. However who knows how loyal they truly are? they live in fear of being purged from the military and may strike at any moment. General Pyotr Krasnov is believed by some to be the only truly loyal general to the Grand Prince left, a close friend of the grand duke who has said he will follow the Grand Prince down any path.\n\nThe people of Muscovy stand strong and while not being supportive of the purges, they have not carried out any sort of mass revolt due to never being targeted by the government. However following the purge of Maslov the streets of Moscow were gloom, as he was seen as fairly liberal compared to most other generals, while not truly liberal in any sense he was simply known to be the least harsh in punishments and treatments to the people."

 muscovy.3.t:0 "Announcement In Moscow Royal Square"
 muscovy.3.d:0 "Earlier people in and around Moscow were gathered in the Royal Square for an announcement and people across the nation were gathered into their local town squares where radios were set up for an announcement that would change Muscovy for ever. With loyal General Krasnov beside him, the Grand Prince began a speech on his purges over the past 15 years, he goes into detail of how they were necessary for the future of the great nation. Following him speaking about his justifications for the purges, he goes onto his big announcement.\n\nThe crowd goes silent, then after a few seconds they burst into clapping and cheers as the Grand Prince had announced something no one expected, a mass liberalization of the nation. After the crowd has calmed he continues, he speaks about how he feared that many of the old generals would have attempted a coup against him as many supported the authoritaraian government but a mass single purge at once would have caused too much trouble. He ends his speech with an apology for the totalitarianism the people have suffered over the past 20 years of his reign and his predecessors, he also says he will abdicate the thrown to his son after the reforms are through. Today the Grand Prince surprised many, but he made many people happy."

 muscovy.4.t:0 "Anti-Slave Reforms"
 muscovy.4.d:0 "Today is a glorious day for all Mongols and prisoners of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy as Grand Prince Ivan has signed the Liberation Promulgation. The Liberation Promulgation is a act in which has freed all the current slaves to the government which mainly consisted of criminals and Mongol tengrists. Private slavery was not addressed in this act as it had already been banned through out the Grand Duchy. Along with the banning of Slavery comes the tightening of segregation laws between Slavic peoples and people of Altaic and other Central Asian cultures.\nToday is a day to rejoice and be glad as the liberal principles promised by the Grand Prince are finally being enacted. Pyotr Krasnov lead a small force of troops to open the gates at a small labor camp based outside of Moscow which was a surprise to many as in the past Krasnov spoke in favor of keeping the institution of slavery."

 muscovy.5.d:0 "Another glorious day in Muscovy goes on as Newspaper companies across the nation reopen their offices and radio broadcasters come back on the air as Grand Prince Ivan ends censorship within Muscovy. An institution that has been in place since long before the founding of the grand duchy or even the sacking of Moscow by the hordes, and one that has been growing more stronger and opressive since especially in recent years is over. Of course some forms of censorship still exist, however people are now free to release their own newspaper, publish their own books or even start their own radio show if they so desire. Another step towards freedom in the nation has been achieved and the Grand Prince is really showing his aspiration in giving that freedom to his people, people grow to love the Grand Prince more and more every day now, one day we will look back and rejoice at this hero who God has blessed us with."

 muscovy.6.d:0 "With the recent liberal reforms coming to the Grand Duchy, the Grand Prince has decided to also appease the ordaists by releaseing the leaders of the Ordaist Party. The Ordaist Party leadership was arrested during a Anti-monarchsit purge in the late 1920s and they have been in prison since, they even lead a mass prison riot in 1933 which lead to the death of 3 prisoners.\nThe Grand Princes change of heart on the ordaists come with their change, the ordaists have supported the Grand Princes reforms and cheered him on since he ended slavery in the nation. The Grand Prince seeing this as an opprotunity to win the party over even more was a deal breaker for him."

 muscovy.7.d:0 "The Grand Prince has been in the final stages of his reforms and has invited Aleksei F. Aladin, leader of the Leageue of Liberal Rights to help draft an outline for the new constitution of Muscovy. They discussed many things from how the electoral system shall work to the amount of power the Prime Minister shall hold. The constitution will present the country with a proportional democracy using the popular vote, this will allow for what the people want to be represented more easily. Along with the discussion on the constitution they discussed more personal things which they did not disclose. The meeting concluded with them shaking hands and Aladin heading back to the head quarters of the League of Liberal Rights. The evolution of the nation is starting to show more than ever today, and with the signing of the new constitution being just over a week away the people grow more and more exicted and festitvies have already started taking place."

 muscovy.8.t:0 "A Real Horror Story"
 muscovy.8.d:0 "Today is a rainy and dark day, but it doesn't bother anyone as today is the day the Grand Prince hands a majority of state powers to the Duma of Muscovy, people gathered from all over the nation in Moscow and in the Duma. The Grand Prince enters the main hall of the Duma, with him is royal guards and his son Crown Prince Nikita, heir to the thrown of Muscovy. They walk to the front slowly in ceremonial fashion, the people stare, journalists take pictures and the doors close behind them when they are at the front the Grand Prince turns to the crowd and bows. Aleksei Aladin, Alexander Kerensky, Georgy Lvov and Arkady Mishkin all walk forward, they bow to the Grand Prince and shake his hand, following this the Grand Prince makes a speech, similar to his one in the Moscow Royal Square almost two months ago however very different at the same time, and much more inspiring. After the Grand Prince finishes his speech a royal guardsman brings out a document and lays it on the table infront of the men. Each of the 4 politicians sign the document as well as Crown Prince Nikita, Grand Prince Ivan moves forward to sign the document.\n\nThe Grand Prince prepares to sign the document when a gun shot is heard from outside the halls doors, everyone including the Grand Prince is startled, before he could sign the document the doors swing open violently. Smoke is comes in from the doors, a royal guardsman walks out choking on his own blood as he collapes, a few men walk through the doorway. Pyotr Krasnov, Patriarch Sergius, and General Pyotr Wrangel all walk through surrounded by soldiers, they walk to the front as the soldiers stand at each row of seats and others shoot the royal guards. The three men continue walking to the front when the Grand Prince stands and asks them what they think they are doing, they continue walking to the front and stop at the table. Krasnov walks to the Grand Prince, and says to him.\n\nOld Friend, on this day you try and ruin this country with ideas of crazy liberals, well I will not have it.\n\nKrasnov pulls out his holstered gun, aims it at the head of the Grand Prince and pulls the trigger, the Grand Prince falls to the ground and to many it feels like time has slowed down. Krasnov turns to the crowd and says there will be no liberty in Moscow, everyone including the politicians run out of the room screaming.\n\nEarlier in the day, the rain was nothing but a little water but now it is a symbol of the extreme sadness and horror that came, may God watch over Muscovy."

 muscovy.9.t:0 "Leftist Leadership Flees"
 muscovy.9.d:0 "When Krasnov couped the government he had the opprotunity to arrest or even execute prominent leftists, instead he generously let them go in what seems to show that his issue was with the Grand Prince himself. Due to him letting them go they have fleed the nation in fear of future prosecution, Kerensky, Aladin and Krestinsky were all last seen together boarding a train with their families heading to Novgorod. Grigori Sokolnikov, leader of the Ordaist Party of Muscovy was also among the many people who fled the nation, him like many Bolshevik leadership was last seen heading towards Kalmykistan where prominent Bolshevik ally of Slavic and Kalmyk descent Vladimir Lenin is based.\n\nWhile our nation mourns the death of our glorious Grand Prince Ivan IX, these traitors flee the nation in which only shows they cared about power. Is it possible these actions could show that Krasnov is actually trying to save the nation from corruption? Only time can truly tell if Krasnov is a really a curse like he currently seems or if he is a blessing sent by God."

Their arrests were made public by a speech made by General Krasnov himself for the whole nation to hear over radio, he promised no execution of the Bolsehvik leaders would come, however they will be locked away for life.

General Krasnov ordered the military round up the main members of the Rurik dynasty and have them put on planes; most of the family seems to have fled west to friendly monarchies in Europe, like Francia and Denmark. While there hasn't been a massive vocal opposition to this act, there still was a small one; the group known as the Moskvin Gang is a monarchist gang located mainly in the city of Moscow, the gang has gone on to say they only recognize Crown Prince Nikita, and claim he is Grand Prince Nikita. They are not of importance, the Moskvin Gang has small numbers and if they did ever try anything, their bases would be raided and taken down very quickly.\n\nToday is the true start of a Muscovy without a monarchy, maybe the royal family should have been murdered, but that is not important as General Krasnov has chosen to let them go and the Generals word is the word we shall follow. Muscovy has entered a new age, an age of wonder, an age of power, the Age of Krasnov!"

Aladin was a main force in the liberalization of Muscovy, someone Krasnov could have executed alongside the former Grand Prince, however he did not and Aladin fled the country and that is something we must deal with. The purge came because despite him fleeing instead of staying and attempting to fight, Aladin supporters still called for Liberalization and his rise to power. Prominent supporters such as Perestoronin Damir and Aleksandr Naumov were killed while popular figure in Aladin's party, Nikolai Pokrovsky was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThis purge marks the rule of Krasnov, it shows just how is power is growing, how he will become the strongest Muscovite leader in history and will prove those former monarchs as fools.

Krasnov then addressed the crowd to say he is no longer General Krasnov, but now Povelitel Pyotr Krasnov of The State of Muscovy. The crowd at first hesitant but slowly began to clap for their new leader hiding their concern for where he will bring the country next.\n\nFollowing the speech flags across the nation were replaced with the new flag, and portraits of the royal family confiscated and replaced with photos of the Povelitel.

He has also gone on to say that the nation should keep an Orthodox stance, something Krasnov is not entirely in favor of. The Krasnov Reforms were quite controversial however they were enacted by the Povelitel and even if the Grand Duchy does not exist anymore, speaking out against the Povelitel is treasonous.

The city of Tula is occupied by the generals forces and is standing strong, The Povelitel has not made any advacncements and has called for the military to stand down for now.

Maslov has the city completed fortified and prepared for an attack, even if we launch an attack it will take a few days for reinforcements from other areas of the nation to respond but it is the best option, so we can see these horrid traitors burn on a stake.

In an age of treason it isn't surprising that one of the first traitors of the regime would continue down the path of treason and join the party of war lords. May Maslov meet a slow and painful death at the hands of his own kin in an act of treason, may he feel betrayed like Krasnov felt.\n\nIf Maslov does not feel the pain of betrayal he certainly will feel the pain of death soon enough once Krasnov and his few loyal supporters muster the strength to take back Muscovy."

Today they have marched into the city towards Krasnov palace and when the reached the palace the guards let down their weapons and stood aside, they entered the palace, stormed the halls and killed any guards not complying. They eventually found the locked Study of Krasnov, they blew the door open and found it empty. For nearly an hour the study was searched for a secret switch to a passage way and the finally found one, disguiesed as a book about the former Grand Dukes; Maslov pulled the switch and it lead to a dark winding staircase. Soldiers walked down to find a small room, looking like a dungeon, with chains on the wall and a whip on a hook and laying in the corner was Krasnov. The soldiers dragged Krasnov up the steps and put him on his knees infront of Maslov, Maslov pulled out his pistol and aimed it at Krasnovs head, Krasnov began to cry as the smell of urine filled the room; Maslov pulled the gun from Krasnovs head and told the guards to put him into a prison. The Humiliated Povelitel was dragged out of the palace as Maslov had the building raided of valuables to be sent to Tula.\n\nToday the regime of Krasnov has ended, and the Tula Council regime begins.

Already they have begun to remove any individual suspected of treason against Muscovy, raiding their houses in the night and taking them away to be punished.
