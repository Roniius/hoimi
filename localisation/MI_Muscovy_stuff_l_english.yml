 SOV_MONGOLII_IMPERIUM_DESC:0 "Muscovy stands as it has for centuries, a symbol of Eastern European independence. During the years following the end of Mongol control, Muscovy was in a state of reconstruction and for a while it was weak, almost completely up for grabs to all outsiders but no one took the chance. After some time, Muscovy pulled itself up and began pushing back the old hordes of the former Mongol Empire. Muscovy had become one of the largest nations in Europe, nearly unstoppable in it's might."

 muscovy.1.d:0 "Muscovy stands as it has for centuries, a symbol of Eastern European independence. During the years following the end of Mongol control, Muscovy was in a state of reconstruction and for a while it was weak, almost completely up for grabs to all outsiders but no one took the chance. After some time, Muscovy pulled itself up and began pushing back the old hordes of the former Mongol Empire. Muscovy had become one of the largest nations in Europe, nearly unstoppable in it's might.\n\nTimes have changed since those days: The Grand Duke seems persistent on fruitless purges: The people fear he is mad. With Novgorod to the North and Lithuania to the west, the weakened nation may find itself in a more vulnerable position then ever.. However that is only foreign problems, to say that Muscovy is clear of domestic problems would be a complete lie, in fact, Muscovy is sprawling with different factions, from the Marxist Party of Muscovy, known mostly as The Bolsheviks to the Russian Unionist Party. While most factions remain fairly peaceful, if the Grand Duke was to target them who knows what they may do?"

 muscovy.2.t:0 "A New Purge"
 muscovy.2.d:0 "It was a normal day, Moscow had people in the streets walking back and forth between their jobs and their homes, to the market place, the church or the many other places in the daily lives of a Muscovite. However it all took a sharp turn when a military barrack was stormed and personal including General Taras Maslov were dragged into a military truck and were driven off. The people of course knew what this was, it was another purge by the Grand Duke, as he consolidates his power very few generals remain. However who knows how loyal they truly are? they live in fear of being purged from the military and may strike at any moment. General Pyotr Krasnov is believed by some to be the only truly loyal general to the Grand Duke left, a close friend of the grand duke who has said he will follow the Grand Duke down any path.\n\nThe people of Muscovy stand strong and while not being supportive of the purges, they have not carried out any sort of mass revolt due to never being targeted by the government. However following the purge of Maslov the streets of Moscow were gloom, as he was seen as fairly liberal compared to most other generals, while not truly liberal in any sense he was simply known to be the least harsh in punishments and treatments to the people."

 muscovy.3.t:0 "Announcement In Moscow Royal Square"
 muscovy.3.d:0 "Earlier people in and around Moscow were gathered in the Royal Square for an announcement and people across the nation were gathered into their local town squares where radios were set up for an announcement that would change Muscovy for ever. With loyal General Krasnov beside him, the Grand Duke began a speech on his purges over the past 15 years, he goes into detail of how they were necessary for the future of the great nation. Following him speaking about his justifications for the purges, he goes onto his big announcement.\n\nThe crowd goes silent, then after a few seconds they burst into clapping and cheers as the Grand Duke had announced something no one expected, a mass liberalization of the nation. After the crowd has calmed he continues, he speaks about how he feared that many of the old generals would have attempted a coup against him as many supported the authoritaraian government but a mass single purge at once would have caused too much trouble. He ends his speech with an apology for the totalitarianism the people have suffered over the past 20 years of his reign and his predecessors, he also says he will abdicate the thrown to his son after the reforms are through. Today the Grand Duke surprised many, but he made many people happy."
