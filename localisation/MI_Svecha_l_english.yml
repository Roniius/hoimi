 svecha_post_tula.1.d:0 "News has come in from the eastern most regions of our control, the Tashqi Mongulians have begun to assume power in towns and military bases. The commander at Fort Boris sent word saying that he fort was handed over to Tashqi Mongulian leader Kutlugh Karmov, Karmov and 54 armed men marched to the base, and stood outside; Karmov then went on to demand the commander hand over control of the base.\n\nThis situation seems like it could be a second Tula Incident, however the regions we control have historically been home of Free Tashqi Mongulians and Kuznetsov has had somewhat of a track record of being against racism. If we consider allowing peace between the Tashqi Mongulians and us Muscovites, Karmov may allow for us Muscovites to stay in the region with them allowing for a government without racism.\nSo far Karmov has been completely harmless in his advances in the east and no blood has been spilt, some local Tashqi Mongulians have even begun calling him a The Saviour. This maybe a turn in the direction we need to head, maybe Karmov really is a Saviour, but does his creed allow for prosperity between Muscovites and Tashqi Mongulians? Only time will tell."

 svecha_post_tula.2.d:0 "In the center of the city a Tashqi Mongulian man was walking wearing a patch of Karmov's Army, a officer in the center square was present as well and spotted the man and his patch and marched over to him. The officer proceeded to rip off the mans patch and spit in his face, when the man went down to pick up his patch while ignoring the officer, the officer kicked him to the ground followed by pulling out his side arm and shooting the man. People gathered quickly and started to pour in around the officer yelling and screaming, fellow officers came in and escorted the officer out, this outraged the people protesting what the officer had just done. The outraged people especially Mongulians began to attack the officers who fired into the crowd with their weapons, however this was not enough and the crowd soon overpowered them; the crowd then begun to wreck havoc across the city, officers were ordered by superiors to not fire anymore based on orders from Kuznetsov however the damage was done.\n\nWithin two hours a city that was fairly peaceful descended into chaos, the flag of Karmov's army was risen in many locations as Tashqi Mongulians began to take a hold over the city with support of some sympathetic Muscovites. Word is going around that Karmov and his army are marching to Svecha now, while this has not developed into a full out revolution we are facing a big issue, and if we are not lucky we may end up like that poor man in Svecha's center square."

 svecha_post_tula.3.d:0 "It has been half a month since the riots broke out in Svecha, with the city covered in smoke from fire, the people live lawlessly in the city, Kuznetsov has ordered the entire army stand on guard of his palace in Svecha while he debates with his inner circle how this mass riot should be dealt with. Atleast this was the case until Kutlugh Karmov arrived in Svecha, Karmov's first actions were ordering his men to help feed the hungry in the streets as men and women, men and women surrounded Karmov in the streets, mostly Mongulians but many Muscovites joined in to surround him while bowing and chanting \"Avrasitel\" or Saviour in Tashqi Mongulian.\n\nFollowing the gathering around Karmov, Karmov continued his march through the city towards Kuznetsov's Palace. People continued to pour into the crowd following Karmov, they all marched through the streets, many people still chanting Avrasitel while others sang the song of Mongulian freedom. They eventually reached the palace and were ordered to stop by the men stationed to protect it; Karmov stepped forward and asked for an audience with Kuznetsov. The guards denied any access while Kuznetsov stepped outside and asked for the guards to let him through, the men went into the Palace and talked for a few hours and when they returned outside. Kuznetsov and Karmov together rose their hands in the air while Karmov held in his other hand the official declaration of independence of Tashqi Mongul, Kuznetsov has stepped down as the leader of the region and Karmov has taken his place.\n\nA new age is ahead for the Tashqi Mongulians, blessed by God. Karmov has begun to construct a constituion with Kuznetsov their inner circles, in time we will see what path this nation takes and hopefully that is the path of Egalitarian democracy."
