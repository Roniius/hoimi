 england_newcastle_film.1.d:0 "Monroe Staples Films Inc. one of the top studios of the Newcastle Film Industry has recently bought smaller studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios more commonly known as MGM. A deal in the works since late 1935 when MGM had a large string of box office failures and it needed to find some way to stay afloat, this gave Monroe Staples Jr. current CEO of Monroe Staples Films the idea to purchase it along with the rights to everthing owned by MGM which includes the hit cartoon Felix The Cat. Staples has said he plans on bringing sound to Felix The Cat and many of MGMs other cartoons in order to modernize them.\n\nThis purchase was criticized by Royal Walt Studios owner Walter E. Disney who claims the purchase and reinventing of Felix The Cat is simply due to fear of the rising success of Disney's successful cartoon character Mickey Mouse."
