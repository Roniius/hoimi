 mongolia.1.t:0 "The Eternal Khanate\nMongolia"
 mongolia.1.d:0 "The Mongolian Khanate, which has existed under the Genghisid line of the Borjigin Dynasty for the past 730 years has seen massive gains and losses. Before the mighty Ghenghis Khan, the Mongolian people were nothing but tribal federations. Ghenghis Khan united Mongolia and under him we became a nation. Reaching lands as far west as Central Germany and Palestine, as South as New Delhi and the Chinese Hong Kong, and as far East as Tokyo, our Khanate thrived but we could not hold on to it. Now we are much smaller, and while we are still one of the most powerful nations of the world, we have stagnated. However, with our advanced scientific base, we will restore our former strength.\n\nMongolia under its Mongolian Constitutionalism which shares traits with the European Prussian Constitutionalism sees many factions wanting control. The Khan League is an authoritarian group who wishes to see the system keep its status quo, some even wishing to abolish the constitution to give the Khan absolute power. The Khan League are directly opposed by The Mongolian Liberation Party, a united front of many different ideologies who have formed a single faction wishing to liberalise Mongolia and bring it to a similar government to that of England in the British Isles. With these two factions controlling The Mongolian Legislative Council, the Head Councilmen, who was chosen by the Khan himself is a declared independent however is rumored to have sympathies to The Khan League. Other than these two major factions of the Khanate there is other groups, including the Mongolian Republican Guard, a radical group who opposes the Khanate altogether and wishes to establish a democratic republic in Mongolia. We also have the Adoist Mongolian Restoration Front, who wish to end every shred of liberalism in the Khanate and bring it back to the glory days when the Khanate spread from Europe to South East Asia. Finally we have the Ordaist Mongolian Ordaist Union, another radical republican group, however they wish to enforce the Socialist policies of Ordaism onto the nation, something many fear of happening. While other groups are rumored to exist, they have all been dismissed as rumors or deemed as non-threatening.\n\nMay The Khanate forever stay united, All Hail The Khan and all Hail The Khanate."
