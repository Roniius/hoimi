 MON_a_thirst_for_democracy:0 "A Thirst For Democracy"
 MON_a_thirst_for_democracy_desc:0 "The people of Mongolia wish to see democracy within the Khanate. With democracy implemented in name only in the Khanate for the past 106 years, the want for a real democratic regime has been escalating for a long while. Let's hope this doesn't escalate too much."
 MON_split_military:0 "Split Military"
 MON_split_military_desc:0 "In a country where men from ages 18-30 are randomly drafted, there is bound to be a portion of said men who support certain political movements. Surveys have shown that as much as ~49% of the military support some sort of democracy in Mongolia. This has created a great rift in the military, and while no one refuses to fight in the army in fear of being killed, many fights are reported between soldiers due to their very different political views."
 MON_failing_economy:0 "Failing Economy"
 MON_failing_economy_desc:0 "Mongolia's economy has been in a state of decline for the last 10 years. While it has not had a major impact on their status as a great power, the Khanate is weaker because of it. Many groups claim they have a solution to this issue, yet they are not willing to back up their claims with evidence."
 MON_unrestrained_corruption:0 "Unrestrained Corruption"
 MON_unrestrained_corruption_desc:0 "The entirety of Mongolia has some knowledge, albeit little, about the corruption in their country. Yet if they knew of its rapid growth in recent years, they would be on the streets speaking out agaisnt the government."

 mongolia.1.t:0 "The Eternal Khanate\nMongolia"
 mongolia.1.d:0 "The Mongolian Khanate, which has existed under the Genghisid line of the Borjigin Dynasty for the past 730 years, has seen massive gains and losses. Before the mighty Genghis Khan, the Mongolian people were nothing but tribal federations. He united Mongolia and under him we became a nation. Reaching lands as far west as Germany and the Levant, as far south as Delhi and Xianggang, and as far east as Edo, our Khanate thrived. Yet we could not hold on to our lands for too long. Now we are much smaller, and while we are still one of the most powerful nations of the world, we have stagnated. However, with our advanced scientific base, we will restore our former strength.\n\nMongolia, under its Mongolian constitutionalism, which shares traits with the European Prussian constitutionalism, sees many factions wanting control. The Khan League is an authoritarian group who wishes to see the system keep its status quo, some of its members even wishing to abolish the constitution to give the Khan absolute power. The Khan League are directly opposed by The Mongolian Liberation Party, a united front of many different ideologies who have formed a single faction whose aims are to liberalise Mongolia and model its government in the form of England's in the British Isles. With these two factions largely controlling The Mongolian Legislative Council, the Head Councilman, who was chosen by the Khan himself, is a declared independent. However, he is rumored to have sympathies to The Khan League. Other than these two major factions of the Khanate there are other groups, including the Mongolian Republican Guard, a radical group who opposes the Khanate altogether and wishes to establish a democratic republic in Mongolia. There is also the Adoist Mongolian Restoration Front, who wish to purge liberalism from the Khanate and bring it back to its former glory, when it spread from Europe to Southeast Asia. Finally, we have the Mongolian Ordaist Union, another radical republican group. However, unlike the other groups, they seek to implement the socialist policies of Ordaism in the nation, something that is feared by many people. While other groups may exist, they have all been dismissed as rumors or deemed as non-threatening.\n\nMay The Khanate forever stay united! All hail The Khan! All hail The Khanate!"
